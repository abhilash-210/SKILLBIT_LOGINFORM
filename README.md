# SKILLBIT_LOGINFORM

This project is a simple web-based login and registration form application. It allows users to create an account by registering with their email and password, and then log in using those credentials. The application features client-side form validation and stores user data securely in the browser's localStorage for demonstration purposes. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it easy to understand and extend for learning or prototyping authentication workflows.
